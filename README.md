This project dataset was taken from ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/twitter-sentiment-analysis2/overview).

The task is to build a model that will determine the tone (neutral, positive, negative) of the text. 
Multiple models have been trained and compared using a cross-validation approach along with scoring
metrics, such as confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
